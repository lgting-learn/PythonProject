Once upon a time there was a baby eagle living in a nest perched
on a cliff overlooking a beautiful valley with waterfalls and streams,
trees and lots of little animals, scurrying about enjoying their lives.
The baby eagle liked the nest. It was the only world he had ever
known. It was warm and comfortable, had a great view, and even better,
he had all the food and love and attention that a great mother eagle
could provide. Many times each day the mother would swoop down from the
sky and land in the nest and feed the baby eagle delicious morsels of
food. She was like a god to him, he had no idea where she came from or
how she worked her magic.
The baby eagle was hungry all the time, but the mother eagle
would always come just in time with the food and love and attention he
craved. The baby eagle grew strong. His vision grew very sharp. He felt
good all the time.
Until one day, the mother stopped coming to the nest.
The baby eagle was hungry. "I'm sure to die," said the baby
eagle, all the time.
"Very soon, death is coming," he cried, with tears streaming
down his face. Over and over. But there was no one there to hear him.
Then one day the mother eagle appeared at the top of the
mountain cliff, with a big bowl of delicious food and she looked down at
her baby. The baby looked up at the mother and cried "Why did you
abandon me? I'm going to die any minute. How could you do this to me?"
The mother said, "Here is some very tasty and nourishing food,
all you have to do is come get it."
"Come get it!" said the baby, with much anger. "How?"
The mother flew away.
The baby cried and cried and cried.
